                <ol class="aadharpay-ol">
                    <li>Aadhaar Pay is the easiest method of accepting payments from your customers through aadhaar linked bank account. AEPS payment method allows retailers to accept cashless payments without debit or credit cards, which is suitable for taking payments from customers who do not have access to these basic financial necessities.</li>
                    <li>It is a payment system which allows merchants to collect payments from a customer using his Aadhaar number and biometric authentication. The aadhaar seeded account of the customer gets debited and merchant accounts gets credited.</li>
                    <li>A receipt is printed for each transaction. Just like debit card receipt, Aadhaar number is masked on the receipt with only few digits shown in receipt with balance masked by printing masked digits.</li>
